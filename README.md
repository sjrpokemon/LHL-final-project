# Capstone Project LHL
## Movie Recommendation Engine
## Introduction
##### This repository contains codes for extracting, exploring, modeling, and visualizing the process of developing a movie recommendation system. The focus is on creating distinct clusters and enabling users to view recommendations exclusively within their chosen cluster of interest.
##### Two Recommendation Methods:
    1.1 Recommending movies similar to user-preferred ones
    1.2 Recommending movies based on other users' ratings

## Methods And Techniques
#### - Machine Learning Methods:

Applied Apriori Algorithm & K-means Clustering:
  - Utilized utility matrix with ratings converted to binary.
  -  Applied Apriori for frequent itemsets and K-means for clustering.
